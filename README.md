"# webpack_mangling_example"

beforeWebpack.html is the html file with the pre-webpack css files
afterWebpack.html is the html file with the post-webpack css file

my custom settings are in the following files:
postcss.config.js
webpack.config.js


I use the following CLI command: `webpack -p --config .\webpack.config.js --display-error-details`
